## Hi there 👋
I’m currently a B.Tech student at IIT Madras (Metallurgical & Materials Engineering), you’ll usually find me knee-deep in code, data, and coffee ☕. My curiosity drives me into the worlds of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analytics, and Data Science. I also love building things in Java, sharpening my skills in Data Structures & Algorithms, and hacking away in Python, C/C++, and Java.

Whether I’m untangling tricky datasets, optimizing algorithms, or just geeking out over new tech, I’m always up for a challenge! 🚀
